## Project 2 - Swiss Tournament Planner

This is a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track
of players and matches in a game tournament.

The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in 
each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with teh samenumber of wins, or as close as possible.

This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the code that will use it.
